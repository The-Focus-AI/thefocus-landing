#About TheFocus.AI/Studio
TheFocus.AI studio was established to explore and create a new working framework for businesses looking to take advantage of the transforming AI ecosystem.

It’s clear that what we call the phone and computer are quickly becoming interfaces where customers can simply ask questions and get answers—allowing interfaces to disappear and reappear only when needed. TheFocus.AI is working not only to help companies adapt to this new world but also to actively contribute to its transformation.

With more than 40 years of combined experience in software engineering and design, Mr. Schippers and Mr. Schenk founded TheFocus.AI to help drive this shift—pushing the boundaries of modern tooling and placing productivity firmly at center stage.

Leveraging the very best in frontier language models and tooling, Schippers and Schenk aspire to define how the next decade of software interaction will unfold across both enterprise and consumer experiences.

While still early, TheFocus.AI has already released applications that begin to establish this new paradigm. The next phase will focus on how user interfaces appear and disappear in a highly curated, context-aware fashion—reimagining interaction for both enterprise and consumer environments.

Feel free to explore a few applications from TheFocus Labs, such as Distill.
