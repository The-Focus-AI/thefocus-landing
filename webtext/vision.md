# About TheFocus
We focus in three main areas for application development

- Connect siloed data to enable prompt user interfaces.
- Establish UIs that are highly curated to the task at hand.
- Distill noise from systems for focused and productive time.


## Problem: PROBLEM - CONSUMERS AND THE ENTERPRISE ARE OVERWHELMED

Consumers are overwhelmed by algorithms, phone notifications and inundated with busy and distracting user interfaces- booking travel, social media etc.

The enterprise is lost in a sea of data, they can’t get get access to.
