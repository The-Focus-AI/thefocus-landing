## Tweet 1 (January 15)

It's called Claude Code. I use it for everything except code.

This month:
- Researched job candidates
- Built grocery lists across stores
- Extracted data from apps with no export
- Planned a 5-hour meal prep

I describe what I want. Claude figures out how.

The most useful AI pattern:

1. Ask Claude to do something
2. Let it figure out how
3. Ask it to document the process

By day 10 of my fast, the project file was 300+ lines. I'd say "my weight is 90.7" and Claude knew exactly what to do.

Don't just ask AI to do things. Ask it to remember how.

AI research without citations is just expensive hallucination.

When Claude researches something, I get:
- Findings organized by theme
- Claims tied to sources
- A references section with actual links

"AI found this, here's where, go check" > "AI said so"

## Tweet 4 (January 18)

Claude evaluated my job candidates better than I did.

One looked great—lots of front-end repos. Claude said no.

Why? The "front-end" was mostly Streamlit dashboards over Python ML code. Not actually a front-end dev.

It was right. I would have missed that.

No export button? Save the page. Let Claude dig through the mess.

Bloodwork locked in a React app. "Save Page As" creates a massive HTML file with embedded JS.

Claude extracted clean, structured data I can actually track over time.

Your data. Your format.

## Tweet 6 (January 20)

Tried an "AI browser" tool. It asked me to log into my email.

Deleted immediately.

The fix: session isolation. Each service gets its own cookie universe. Claude can shop on Instacart but has zero access to my main Chrome profile.

Automation without the security nightmare.

Claude planned my meal prep better than I ever could.

Constraints: 2 ovens, slow cooker, air fryer, 5 hours, 7 days of meals.

Output: Time-boxed workflow. Every 15-30 min, a step. Which appliance, what should be running.

5 proteins + sides in under 5 hours.

Newsletter workflow in one conversation:

1. "Research [topic] and write about it"
2. "Make the intro punchier"
3. "Add a section about X"
4. Rewrite everything (mandatory)
5. "Schedule for Friday at 9am"

Claude orchestrates. I just have opinions.

The actual unlock with Claude Code:

Every discovery gets documented back into the system.

- Learned how to sync Oura data? CLAUDE.md
- Website button patterns? Document them
- Good image style? Save the prompt

Future sessions inherit all previous learnings.

Honest about limits.

Claude Code works for:
✓ Research with citations
✓ Hiring pipelines
✓ Content workflows
✓ Data extraction
✓ Sandboxed browser automation

Doesn't work for:
✗ Real-time interaction
✗ High-stakes financial decisions
✗ 100% reliability requirements

## Tweet 11 (January 25)

Claude Code isn't a coding tool. It's a capability orchestrator.

Started: "help me track my weight"

Ended: API integrations, research reports, daily infographics, meal planning, automated grocery shopping.

The question isn't "can it code?" It's "what do you want done?"
