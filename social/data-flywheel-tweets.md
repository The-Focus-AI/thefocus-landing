# Tweets: The Data Flywheel Pattern

Based on "The Data Flywheel Pattern" - https://thefocus.ai/posts/data-flywheel-pattern/

## Tweet 1 - Main Hook (January 22)

I stopped designing applications.

Now I just drop files into folders and let Claude figure out the rest.

3 systems built this way:
- Business operations tracker
- Personal health dashboard
- Media synthesis engine

No database. No API. No schema.

Here's how it works:

## Tweet 2 - The Provocation (January 23)

Controversial take: database schemas are technical debt from day one.

My "database" is a folder of markdown files.

When the structure needs to change, Claude just... changes it. No migrations. No ORM updates. No API versioning.

"But that doesn't scale!"

It scales to exactly what I need.

## Tweet 3 - Operations Hook (January 24)

I let AI evaluate 48 job candidates.

Before you get angry: it researched their GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolios. Built skills matrices. Flagged concerns I would have missed.

One candidate looked perfect. Claude said no—their "React experience" was actually Streamlit dashboards.

It was right.

## Tweet 4 - Speed Hook (January 25)

Built a working health tracker in 90 minutes.

Not a prototype. A real app with:
- API integration
- Data visualization
- Auto-refresh dashboard

First commit: README
Second commit (9 min later): 424-line API script
Third commit (18 min later): Full HTML dashboard

Claude wrote all the code.

## Tweet 5 - Rate Limiting (January 26)

I use Claude as my rate limiter.

Not a library. Not retry logic. The actual AI.

Twitter's API has aggressive limits. Instead of coding around them, I tell Claude:

"Monitor the quota. When it drops below 10, stop and process what you have."

It makes better decisions than my code ever did.

## Tweet 6 - The Flywheel (January 27)

The pattern that changed how I build things:

Data in → AI processes → Outputs out → Outputs become new inputs

Each cycle:
- Sources get curated
- Synthesis gets sharper
- System gets smarter

I call it the data flywheel.

Starts slow. Each spin adds momentum.

## Tweet 7 - PDF Parsing (January 28)

"Just use an API"

The PDF has no API. The bloodwork portal has no export. The email is a .eml file.

Claude reads them all.

Dropped a client contract PDF into a folder. Claude extracted:
- Architecture decisions
- Project phases
- Pricing breakdown
- Invoice schedule

My data. My format.

## Tweet 8 - Research Generation (January 29)

Claude wrote 4 research papers for me. With citations.

Not hallucinated citations. Real studies:
- Cahill's starvation research
- Olsson & Saltin 1970
- 15+ sources per report

"3-4g of water is bound with each gram of glycogen"

I can verify every claim.

## Tweet 9 - The Anti-Design (January 30)

Traditional app dev:
1. Design database schema
2. Build CRUD operations
3. Create UI
4. Pray it all stays consistent

Data flywheel:
1. Drop files in folder
2. Tell Claude what they mean
3. Done

Features accrete. Structure emerges. The app grows itself.

## Tweet 10 - Media Distill (January 31)

My content diet used to be chaos.

Now I have a system that:
- Pulls tweets from curated lists
- Downloads YouTube transcripts
- Fetches newsletter emails
- Synthesizes everything into weekly digests

40+ sources → 1 readable summary.

## Tweet 11 - The Three Hard Problems (February 1)

AI handles the hard problems:

1. **Parsing** - PDFs, HTML dumps, API responses, weird email formats

2. **Synthesis** - Raw data → summaries, reports, cited research

3. **Judgment** - When to pause, what to prioritize, what actually matters

You provide data and intent. The flywheel spins.

## Tweet 12 - Getting Started (February 2)

Want to try this?

Pick something you want to track. Find a data source. Tell Claude to import it.

"Track my workouts from Garmin data"
"Synthesize my RSS feeds"
"Monitor my GitHub projects"

First import creates structure.
Fifth import creates a system.
