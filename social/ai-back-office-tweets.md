# Tweets: AI-Powered Back Office

Based on "6 Commands Replace 10+ Hours/Week: Building an AI-Powered Back Office" - https://thefocus.ai/case-studies/ai-back-office/

## Tweet 1 - Main Hook (January 29)

I fired my CRM, project tracker, invoice system, and HR platform.

Replaced them with a folder of text files.

6 commands now run my entire back office. 10+ hours/week saved. $0/month in SaaS.

Everyone said it wouldn't work. It's been 3 weeks. They were wrong.

## Tweet 2 - The Forgotten Invoice (January 30)

A $7,500 invoice sat unpaid for 14 days because I forgot it existed.

Now I run `/daily` every morning.

30 seconds later: "Invoice overdue. If you do nothing else today, follow up on this."

Got paid the next day.

## Tweet 3 - Rejecting Candidates (January 31)

I let AI reject 50 job candidates.

One looked perfect — tons of React experience.

AI said no. Dug into their GitHub. The "React" was actually Streamlit dashboards. Not frontend.

Saved me an interview slot. Every candidate still got a personalized response.

## Tweet 4 - The 3 Week Email (February 1)

"I should send the client an update."

That thought haunted me for 3 weeks. I knew what to say. Just couldn't make myself write it.

Now: `/client-update wobblefish`

8 seconds. Branded email. Gmail draft ready.

The friction killed me. Removing it fixed everything.

## Tweet 5 - Text File Database (February 2)

My invoice database is a markdown table.

"That doesn't scale."

Correct. It scales to exactly what I need: running a business.

No migrations. No ORM. No schema bets on the future.

When I need a new field, I add it. Claude adapts instantly.

## Tweet 6 - Tribal Knowledge (February 3)

"We agreed to push the deadline to the 15th."

Where does that information live? Not in Jira. Not in the CRM.

It evaporates.

Now every call is transcribed. Weekly reports connect conversations to commits. Nothing disappears.

## Tweet 7 - SaaS Breakup (February 4)

$117/month in SaaS fees.

4 separate logins. 4 data silos. 4 vendors who won't let their systems talk without an "Enterprise plan."

Canceled all of it.

Now I have markdown files I own completely. If Claude disappeared tomorrow, my data is still readable.

## Tweet 8 - The Real Problem (February 5)

Project management tools solve the wrong problem.

The hard part isn't tracking tasks. It's that tribal knowledge evaporates.

Two weeks later: "What did we decide about the timeline?"

Everyone has a different memory. The conversation is gone.

Unless you recorded it.

## Tweet 9 - Morning Chaos (February 6)

Old morning routine:
- Check Slack
- Check email
- Check calendar
- Check project board
- Check invoice spreadsheet

1 hour gone. Still missed things.

New morning routine:
- Run `/daily`

30 seconds. Full context. Nothing falls through.

## Tweet 10 - The Hiring Weekend (February 7)

50 applications. One weekend.

Each candidate: researched, evaluated, scored, responded to.

What would have taken 25+ hours done in two days.

Zero guilt about ghosting applicants. Everyone heard back.

The AI does research. The human decides.

## Tweet 11 - Feature Requests (February 8)

Old way: Submit a feature request. Wait 6 months. Get told it's on the roadmap. Never see it.

New way: Describe what I want to Claude. It exists in 10 minutes.

The vendor is me. The roadmap is whatever I need today.

## Tweet 12 - The Insight (February 9)

Most "enterprise software" is just:
- Structured data
- Views
- Workflows

A CRM is contacts + "remind me to follow up."
Invoice system is amounts + "who hasn't paid?"

Markdown holds the data. AI provides the views. Prompts are the workflows.
