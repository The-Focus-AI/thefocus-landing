In either of these sessions, we can ask the llm to reverse engineer the repo into a specifictation:

```
can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, 
developer-ready specification? Include all relevant 
requirements, architecture choices, data handling 
details, error handling strategies, and a testing 
plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.
```

That cost 50 cents.
