[Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/) lets you talk to your computer.

You download it and it will download some whisper models to your computer and then when you activate it, it'll use that to figure out what you're saying. And either enter it into whatever application you are using or into your copy and paste buffer.

The models are pretty smart so it doesn't just understand what you're saying but it kind of cleans up the grammar a little bit.  You can also add different things, prompts to it, so that you can customize the output. I never use that, but that's definitely something you can do.

It's hard for me to write about it because I just use it so much.  I type pretty fast this is way faster.
