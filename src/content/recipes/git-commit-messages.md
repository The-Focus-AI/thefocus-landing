I have a quick prompt that looks at all of the changes staged in Git and writes a commit message based upon that. It's got a title with a little type to it and a little paragraph descriptions of what's going on.

I run at something like this.

```
git diff HEAD | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet "$(cat $HOME/prompts/git-commit-message)
```

Or as a mise task like so:

```
[tasks.commit-message]
description = 'Writes a commit message'
run = [ 'git diff HEAD | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet "$(cat $HOME/prompts/git-commit-message)"' ]
```

## prompt

I'm sure this could be improved upon, but I literally just copied and pasted it from Google search results asking about different ways to format git commits.

```
Write a commit message based upon the diffs of the code.

Each commit has a type, with a short sentence describing 
what it is.  There's a longer paragraph afterwards 
describing the change

feat: Introduces a new feature (correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).
fix: Patches a bug (correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
docs: Documentation changes (e.g., updates to README or other markdown files).
style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.).
refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
perf: Improves performance.
test: Adds missing tests or corrects existing tests.
chore: Changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (e.g., updating dependencies).
build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
ci: Continuous integration related changes
revert: Reverts a previous commit

# Examples

feat: Add new user profile feature
fix(parser): Fix issue with parsing dates
docs: Update README with installation instructions
style: Remove unnecessary whitespace
refactor: Improve code readability
perf: Optimize image loading
test: Add unit tests for new feature
