My [prompt library](https://github.com/The-Focus-AI/prompt-library) can act as a MCP server, so I can tell cursor to do things like:

> install the enhanced memory bank prompt into .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc and run it

Inside of `.cursor/mcp.json` I have the `run-prompt` command set up as a MCP server, like this

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prompt-library": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "/Users/wschenk/prompt-library/run-prompt", "mcp"],
      "cwd": "/Users/wschenk/prompt-library"
    }
  }
}
```

And that exposes a couple of tools

- `list-prompts` - outputs the name of all the prompts available
- `load-prompt` - returns the prompt
- `save-prompt` - saves a new prompt

I can say something like `write a markdown prompt that helps evaluate different libraries and save the prompt`

Later I can say something like `load the library evaluation prompt, which typescript testing library should i use`

Or in cursor, you could say `load up the visual metafor prompt and ask it about @load-and-save-your-prompts.md`
