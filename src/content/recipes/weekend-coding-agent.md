Build a complete AI coding agent from scratch over a weekend. This hands-on tutorial walks through the entire process of creating an agent that can write, test, and improve code.

## What You'll Build

A fully functional coding agent with:
- Tool execution (bash, file operations)
- Context awareness through research reports
- Slash commands for common operations
- Session analysis and resumption

## The Philosophy

This project demonstrates three key ideas:

1. **Prompts to write prompts** - The `/research` command generates research reports that become prompts for future work.

2. **Specialized knowledge** - By loading research reports into the system prompt, the agent has domain-specific knowledge.

3. **Self-improvement** - The agent can summarize its own sessions, identify what it's learned, and resume previous work.
