[repomix](https://repomix.com/) is a great tool that you can use to tell an LLM about all of the context of your project.

You can run it like this

```
npx repomix
```

And it will create a `repomix-output.txt` file that you can send to a LLM.   You can drag the file over, or paste it in:  (works best with claude)

```
cat repomix-output.txt | pbcopy
```

You can also pass this into a local llm, like

```
cat repomix-output.txt | ollama run gemma3:12b "Tell me what you think about all of this"
```

## Tips

When you run `repomix` it shows you how many tokens the files use.

Depending upon what's in there, you can set up `--ignore`:

```
npx repomix --ignore "**/*.json,**/*.ipynb,**/*.mdx"
```

I have a bunch of `mise` tasks that depends on `llm-dump` which I define both in `.config/mise/config.toml` but then override in specific projects as needed.

```
[tasks.llm-dump]
description = 'Runs repomix'
run = ['repomix --ignore "output*,**/*.log,tmp/,inputs/**/*md,data_integrity/**/*.json"']
