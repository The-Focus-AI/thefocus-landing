Ask it to first write tests, and then run them every time after to make it work


```
Think carefully through this specification, and ask any clarifying questions needed to help with the implemtnation and specification
```

# Development

## Always TDD

If you don't have tests, first think you should do is to say

```
Extract the code into modules and write tests for them.  Make sure you run the tests after every change.
```

This is basically the main loop of what you do.
