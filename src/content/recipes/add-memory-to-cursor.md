Lets add a memory system to cursor.

This is adapted from [cline-memory-bank](https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/custom-instructions-library/cline-memory-bank) but I fleshed out the project planning a bit more to be TDD.

I use this with my [load and save prompts](/recipes/load-and-save-your-prompts) pattern to put it in `.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc` and then it will help maintain the state of where you are, and you can tell it to remember things across sessions and it's smart enough to do so.

And I use [product-ideation](/recipes/product-ideation) to come up with the initial project brief.

Sort of a poor-mans claude code.
