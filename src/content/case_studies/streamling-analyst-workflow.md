title: Streamlining data analyst workflow
industry: Media
client: Consumer Startup
year: "2025"
description: We liberated the data from Tableau to allow to make the data in existing data lakes much more accessible to analysts and other business stakeholders.
challenge: The existing workflow to do analysis on data that enterprises already own is incredibly cumbersome and slow. And we wanted to make it possible for ad hoc and accurate queries with proprietary information could be answered quickly.
solution: We implemented a series of agents that deeply understand different concepts embedded inside of the data and allowed analysts to answer multiple queries.
results: |-
  - 78% reduction in document analysis time
  - 92% accuracy in data extraction
  - 35% increase in analyst productivity
  - Identification of 28% more investment opportunities

### Approach & Implementation

Our client, a leading global investment firm, was struggling with the sheer volume of financial reports they needed to analyze to make informed investment decisions. Their analysts were spending up to 60% of their time manually reviewing documents, extracting key metrics, and organizing data for analysis.

We developed a custom schema-driven AI solution that could understand the structure of various financial documents and extract relevant information into a standardized format. The system was trained to recognize different document layouts, tables, charts, and financial terminology.

The solution included:

1. Document preprocessing to handle various formats and layouts 2. Schema-based extraction of key financial metrics, risk factors, and market projections 3. Structured output generation that integrated directly with their existing analysis tools 4. A verification interface that allowed analysts to review and correct AI-extracted data

The implementation transformed their workflow, allowing analysts to focus on high-value activities like investment strategy and decision-making rather than manual data extraction. The structured nature of the AI outputs ensured consistency across analyses and enabled more sophisticated trend identification.
