description: A customer facing mobile application wants to build out their web and interactive experience allowing users to get easier access to their driving and charging data.
challenge: The client wanted to create a new interface to their existing data set that would let consumers ask deeper questions about their driving behavior and help optimize costs.
solution: We implemented a full frontend chat interface that allowed users to browse their existing data set as well as to be able to have conversations with their data and return visually rich results with custom user experience elements.
results: A 27% increase of rate of user aquisition and conversion to their paid offerings

### Approach & Implementation

[Tezlab](https://tezlabapp.com) is a iOS and Android application companion application that allows Tesla and Rivian drivers to track their driving and performance data in their car.  It measures battery health, helps you optimize your charging costs, helps you find navigate the ever growing charging infrastructure, and helps you leap into the electric vehicle lifestyle.

While Tezlab uses extensive machine learning under the hood, we focused on helping build a new front-end to the existing backend infrastructure.  The main development team is continuing to build out new functionality and features on the existing application, and we were able to leverage the existing infrastructure to build a new front-end on the existing data in a number of weeks.

The solution included:

1. Analysis of the existing database and API architecture 
2. User Experience design to help expose the functionality in a new user interface paradigm 
3. A new functionality set based upon planning road trips

This new client application on top of their existing architecture helps add more value to their existing user base with limited impact on current operations and provides them with a baseline to continue to offer new and very accessible product value to people.
