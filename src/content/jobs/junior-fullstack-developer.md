## About Us

Focus.AI is a small, AI-first consultancy. We don't just build AI products for clients - we run the company with AI. Claude Code is our primary development environment. We use AI for everything: code generation, project management, client communications, research. We push the boundaries of what's possible and expect you to do the same.

We're fully remote, async-first, and move fast. Our clients include Samsung, Perplexity, and funded startups across fintech, events, and media.

If you're excited about working *with* AI rather than being replaced by it, this is the place.

## The Role

We're looking for a **junior full-stack developer** to join us on a contract basis (part-time to start, potential for more). You'll work directly with our lead developer on client projects, starting with a two-sided marketplace platform that needs UI polish and feature completion.

This is a great opportunity if you want exposure to real client work across multiple industries and tech stacks.

## What You'll Do

- Build and polish features in Next.js/React applications
- Work with Supabase (PostgreSQL, auth, storage)
- Implement UI designs from Figma
- Fix bugs and close out GitHub issues
- Write clean, tested code
- Participate in async standups and code reviews

## Tech Stack

**Primary (must know):**
- TypeScript
- React / Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Git/GitHub

**Secondary (will learn on the job):**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Row Level Security)
- Clerk or similar auth providers
- Vercel deployment
- AI/LLM integrations (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)

## Requirements

- 0-2 years of professional experience (bootcamp grads welcome)
- Portfolio or GitHub showing React/Next.js work
- Comfortable working independently with async communication
- Based in US timezone (EST/CST/PST)
- Available 15-25 hours/week to start

## Nice to Have

- Experience with Supabase or Firebase
- Familiarity with Figma
- Previous agency or consulting experience

## Mindset

We're looking for someone who wants to be at the bleeding edge of AI-assisted development. You should already be using AI tools daily - Cursor, Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT - and have opinions about what works and what doesn't. If you're the kind of person who tries new models the day they drop, we'll get along.

## Compensation

- **Rate:** $35-50/hour depending on experience
- **Hours:** 15-25 hours/week (flexible)
- **Duration:** 3-month initial contract with potential to extend
- **Growth:** Opportunity to take on more responsibility and projects

## How to Apply

Send an email to **hey@thefocus.ai** with:

1. Your resume or LinkedIn
2. Link to your GitHub or portfolio
3. Which AI model is your favorite and why (Opus, Gemini, qwen3:30b-a3b, deepseek)
4. Your hourly rate expectation and availability

No cover letter needed. We'll review and get back to you within a week.
