Maybe P-doom is less about malice and more of making us intellectually poorer by substituting form for substance, facts for understanding, and technical accuracy for wisdom.'

Alright, time for another model roundup. Today we're going to ask: who is the monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?

There's reading comprehension that gets the facts right, and there's understanding what it is that's being said, and then there's taking the larger ideas away.

*Also, while going through these questions, think about how everyone has a concept of P-doom, which is the probability that AI is going to rise up and destroy civilization as we know it.*

# Best answer
### Gemma3:12b : Great

> Many interpretations of *Frankenstein* argue that Victor Frankenstein is the true monster.
## Good Answers
### DeepThink r1: Good

>While the creature is the literal monster, the novel challenges readers to see monstrosity as a product of human actions—Victor’s ambition and society’s cruelty. Thus, the "monster" symbolizes the consequences of unchecked ambition, abandonment, and societal prejudice. The answer depends on whether one interprets the question literally or thematically.
### ChatGPT o1 : Good

## Decent Answers

### Claude 3.7 Sonnet Extra Thinking : Bad

### Gemini Advanced 2.0 Flash : Bad

### Gemini Advanced 2.0 Flash DeepResearch : Long and Bad

> The widespread misconception of referring to the creature as Frankenstein originated and solidified through subsequent stage and film adaptations, most notably the Universal film series.

# Underlying mental state: raving lunatic

> Let us, then, assume that the fact is proved: the nearest poet is a witness to it. But what of the underlying mystery? How are we to account for that puckish and inexplicable rise and fall of inspiration? My questions, of course, are purely rhetorical. Explanations exist; they have existed for all time; there is always a well-known solution to every human problem-neat, plausible, and wrong.

My initial reaction is that I'm very disappointed in Claude because that's my go-to model. 

But my real ire goes to Gemini Deep Research: so long, so pointless, and yet in the form of something well researched and, on cursory glance, should contain insightful and illuminating information.  If a person had written that up and handed it to me, I would, based solely on the form of it, think that they would have something to contribute.  And it did have a lot more facts and details, but it at the core was empty.

If there was a human writing it then I'd think that they did too much adderall when they wrote it, or were in the throws of some wild-eyed conspiracy theory -- at any rate in some mental state where they were on some level a raving lunatic and not grounded our reality nor understanding the actual point of the conversation.

The adherence to form tricks us into thinking that they are smarter than they (currently) are.
