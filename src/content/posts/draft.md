# Your Post Title

Start your post content here. This is where you'll write the main body of your post.

## Workflow: Daily Notes → Draft → Published

1. **Capture in daily notes** - Just write, no pressure
2. **Move to draft** - Copy here when ready to develop
3. **Add required fields** - title, date, description
4. **Polish gradually** - Edit in Obsidian (it's symlinked!)
5. **Add image** - Place in src/content/assets/cards/
6. **Publish** - Set `published: true`
