# Thought without purpose

>  "Thinking occurs when things are uncertain or doubtful or problematic. Thinking is a process of inquiry, of looking into things, of investigating.  All thinking is research, and all research is native, original, with him who carries it on, even if everybody else in the world already is sure of what he is still looking for.  It also follows that all thinking involves a risk. The conclusions of thinking, till confirmed by the event, are, accordingly, more or less tentative or hypothetical." \

# Nietzsche
For millennia, humans saw intelligence in everything—stones, rivers, tools—requiring rituals and negotiations with a world alive with intention. This wasn't mere superstition but recognition that agency exists beyond human form.

We've since dismissed these beliefs, claiming rational superiority over our ancestors. Yet ironically, as we now deliberately embed intelligence into silicon—creating entities with goals potentially orthogonal to our own—we're forced to relearn what our ancestors understood intuitively: how to coexist with non-human minds.

The alignment challenge isn't just technical but existential: we're once again giving rocks intelligence, but this time by design rather than perception. Our ancestors' approaches to respecting, negotiating with, and establishing boundaries around non-human intelligence may contain wisdom more relevant than our modern dismissals suggest.
