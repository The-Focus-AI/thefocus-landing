For millennia, humans saw intelligence in everything—stones, rivers, tools—requiring rituals and negotiations with a world alive with intention. This wasn't mere superstition but recognition that agency exists beyond human form.

We've since dismissed these beliefs, claiming rational superiority over our ancestors. Yet ironically, as we now deliberately embed intelligence into silicon—creating entities with goals potentially orthogonal to our own—we're forced to relearn what our ancestors understood intuitively: how to coexist with non-human minds.

The alignment challenge isn't just technical but existential: we're once again giving rocks intelligence, but this time by design rather than perception. Our ancestors' approaches to respecting, negotiating with, and establishing boundaries around non-human intelligence may contain wisdom more relevant than our modern dismissals suggest.
