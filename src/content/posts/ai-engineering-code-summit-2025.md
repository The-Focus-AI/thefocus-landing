## Overview

The November 2025 AI Engineering Code Summit brought together leading practitioners, researchers, and tool builders to discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-powered software development. This comprehensive report captures key insights, emerging patterns, and actionable recommendations from the summit.

**Key Themes Covered:**

- **Production-Ready AI Engineering** - Moving from experiments to reliable systems
- **Infrastructure Evolution** - New patterns for AI-native architectures
- **Developer Experience** - Tools and workflows that actually work
- **Cost & Performance** - Optimizing for real-world constraints
- **Security & Governance** - Building responsible AI systems

## What's Inside

The full interactive report includes:

- **40+ speaker sessions** with presentations and slides
- **Detailed session summaries** from 3 days of content
- **Emerging patterns analysis** - 4 key patterns reshaping development
- **Live demos and code examples** - Real implementations
- **Interactive visualizations** - Tools and framework comparisons
- **Best practices and recommendations** - Actionable next steps
- **Video recordings** - Full sessions (where available)
- **Community discussions** - Q&A and debates
- **Resource links** - Tools, frameworks, and further reading

## Key Highlights

**The State of AI Engineering:** What was experimental in 2024 is now production-standard in 2025. Agentic workflows, 200K+ context windows, and multi-modal development are the new baseline.

**Emerging Patterns:**
