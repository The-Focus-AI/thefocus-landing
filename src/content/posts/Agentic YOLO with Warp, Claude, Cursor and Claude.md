description: "The process of turning an abstract concept into something more concrete, often by treating it as if it were a physical object or an entity with real existence. This can be useful in philosophy, sociology, and computer science, but it can also lead to misleading assumptions if people start treating abstract ideas as if they have an independent, physical reality."

> “The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.”

I was in the car the other day and I talked to ChatGPT for over an hour.

I kicked off the conversation with a prompt from the tool kit, and we went back and forth, as I was driving through the night. It was all "that's great, but what about this?" and "These two things can't fit together, maybe we could fix it like this?" And I would either just agree, tell it that's completely off base, and then we're tweak and revise.

We were 40 questions in before I think we answered all the things we needed to and then it spit out for me a very detailed product spec of something I wanted to build. Back and forth, back and forth. And at the end it was distilled down to a concise script.

Then I threw it at Claude Code and just yolo'd the shit out of it. 

Yes yes yes every time yes not looking at a single thing.

And it worked.

## Sculpting thought-stuff

> **Reification**: The process of turning an abstract concept into something more concrete, often by treating it as if it were a physical object or an entity with real existence. This can be useful in philosophy, sociology, and computer science, but it can also lead to misleading assumptions if people start treating abstract ideas as if they have an independent, physical reality.

It worked with a lot less supervision than I'd expect.  The whole thing started by accident, really.  I got a fancy new laptop and I wanted to see how to run vision models on it.  I found [mflux](https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux) which did a fantastic not just getting my GPUs running hot, but also of making [some really fun images](https://willschenk.com/howto/2025/running_flux_locally_on_a_mac/). 

I was running all of these commands in the [warp intelligent terminal](https://www.warp.dev/i), and I had run all of these commands individually.  I just asked it -- literally typed, in the same space I was working in, "can you write a script that makes it easier to do all these things" -- and off it went, looking through my command history, figuring out the patterns, and spit it out.

I played around with that for a while.  Tried a bunch of different things.

We occasional went down some path that we couldn't get out of, and it make more sense just to throw it all away and start again.  This is eventually what we ended up with the [mflux-wrapper](https://github.com/The-Focus-AI/mflux-wrapper) , which you can download and run on your own computer.

It lets you do stuff like this

## From warp to claude

At some point warp was getting overwhelmed, so I threw everything away.  How




## From claude to Cursor


# Everyone will have to explain to the robot how you want it to fold your clothes

In warp, I just asked typed in "how do I add metadata to a png file" and it thought for a bit, checked to see what was installed on my computer, and spit out the command.

What is going to happen to programmers?  What is the AI job disruption.  I think it's going to be like literacy over time.
