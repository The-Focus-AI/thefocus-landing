I was in the car the other day and I talked to ChatGPT for over an hour.

I kicked off the conversation with a prompt from the tool kit, and we went back and forth, as I was driving through the night. It was all "that's great, but what about this?" and "These two things can't fit together, maybe we could fix it like this?" And I would either just agree, tell it that's completely off base, and then we're tweak and revise.

We were 40 questions in before I think we answered all the things we needed to and then it spit out for me a very detailed product spec of something I wanted to build. Back and forth, back and forth. And at the end it was distilled down to a concise script.

Then I threw it at Claude Code and just yolo'd the shit out of it. 

Yes yes yes every time yes not looking at a single thing.

And it worked.

I rambled on and on, and I managed to shape that idea into something that another AI

When I wanted to make changed, I went back and forth, and it, more or less, worked right.

You will need to explain to your robot how you want you clothes folded.
