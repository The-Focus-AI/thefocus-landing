    <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-graphite mb-8">
        We started TheFocus.AI because navigating AI is genuinely complex—and most companies don't have time to figure it all out themselves. We're engineers, designers, and strategists who believe the best way to help is to educate as much as we build. <strong class="text-ink">We work directly with founders and product leaders to ship working AI in weeks, not quarters.</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-graphite mb-8">
        AI is changing how people interact with software. Interfaces are becoming conversational. Data is becoming accessible. But making that transition takes clarity—understanding what's possible, what's practical, and what actually fits your business. That's where we come in. Senior engineers on every project, no junior analysts, no endless discovery phases.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-graphite mb-8">
              With more than 40 years of combined experience in software engineering and design, Ben and Will have seen technology cycles come and go. They founded TheFocus.AI with a simple belief: the companies that thrive in the AI era will be the ones that truly understand what they're building and why. That's why education is central to everything we do.

        We work at the intersection of AI and user experience—helping companies connect siloed data, build focused interfaces, and surface what matters from the noise. Every project starts with understanding the problem, not jumping to solutions.

        We've already shipped products that demonstrate what's possible when AI is thoughtfully integrated. But we're just as proud of the clarity we bring to teams who are still figuring out where to start.
